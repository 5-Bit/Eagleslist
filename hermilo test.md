Eagleslist
------


Eagleslist is a used textbook buying and trading service for FGCU students. It is currently being developed by Mostofa Ansary, Hermilo Calderon, Michael MacCallum, Andrew Owen, and John Zachariah as a project for Software Engineering Fundamentals (CEN 3031). When complete, Eagleslist will be available as a Windows application.

Our progress building Eagleslist is being tracked at [5-bit.github.io](https://5-bit.github.io).
